# 100DaysOfCode Challenge by [Neha Patil]

Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode repository! This is where I'll be documenting my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, organized by the 100DaysOfCode community. I'm excited to embark on this coding adventure and improve my coding skills over the next 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. It's a great way to establish a coding habit, work on personal projects, learn new technologies, and connect with a supportive community of fellow developers.

Throughout this challenge, I'll be sharing my progress, experiences, and any insights I gain along the way. By the end of the 100 days, I hope to have accomplished a significant amount of coding, gained valuable knowledge, and grown as a programmer.

## Goals

During this challenge, I have several goals I want to achieve

### 1. Solve  Intermediate and Advanced Problems:
I will consistently work on solving challenging coding problems from platforms like CodeChef and LeetCode. These problems will cover a wide array of topics, including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

### 2. Complete a Web Development Project:
I plan to build a fully functional web application using the skills I've acquired. This project will demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and deploy a web application from start to finish.

### 3. Learn a New Programming Language: 
I want to expand my skill set by learning a new programming language. I'll dedicate time to understand its syntax, best practices, and how it can be applied in real-world projects.

### 4. Daily Coding Practice:
Consistency is key, and I'll make sure to code for at least one hour every day. This practice will help me reinforce what I learn and build a strong foundation in coding.

### 5. Contribute to Open Source:
 I'll actively search for open-source projects that align with my interests and skills. By contributing to these projects, I'll give back to the community and collaborate with other developers.

## Repository Structure
### /logs: 
In this directory, I'll maintain a daily log of my coding progress. Each log will include a brief summary of what I worked on, challenges I faced, and lessons learned.

### /projects: 
This is where I'll keep the code for the projects I'll be working on throughout the challenge. Each project will have its own subdirectory.

### /resources: 
I'll compile a list of resources, tutorials, and articles that I find helpful during the challenge. This will be a reference for both myself and anyone else interested in similar topics.

## Follow Along
I invite you to join me on this coding journey! You can follow my progress by visiting this repository and checking out the daily logs in the /logs directory. Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or questions on the logs or projects.
